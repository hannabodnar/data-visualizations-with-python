### **Project II: Rolling Dice**

Created a class for a 8-sided die, then imported the class to create a visualization for the frequency of the results. Two dice were used, an 8-sided die and 12-sided die. The dice were rolled 30,000 times.

### **Project III: Global Earthquakes**

Worked with global earthquake data in JSON format to map the magnitudes and locations of the earthquakes on a global scale. Data can be found here: https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php

### **Project IV: GitHub API's**

Requested GitHub repository data through an API call. The call was specific to trending repositories written in Python. The visualization features the repositories and the number of watchers.
